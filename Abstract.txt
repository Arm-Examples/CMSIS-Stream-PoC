CMSIS-DSP filer project using Keil RTX5
---------------------------------------

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz

Filter
------
Filter Type:                 Lowpass
Sampling Frequency [Hz]:       32000
Passband Edge Frequency [Hz]:   3200
Passband Ripple [dB]:              0.1
Stopband Edge Frequency [Hz]:   9600
Stopband Attenuation [dB]:        60

Note:
This example uses the CMSIS 5 DSP library and the Keil RTX version 5 real-time
operating system based on CMSIS-RTOS API version 2.
It completely runs in simulation and does not require any hardware to be
present.
